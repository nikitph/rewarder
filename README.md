# Governed Reward Experiment

Minimal runnable experiment for the thesis:

> Reward is not reinforcement until admitted.

The experiment uses a ranking-only setup rather than model fine-tuning. Each
synthetic coding task receives several candidate patch outcomes. A raw selector
chooses the patch with the highest raw reward, while a governed selector chooses
the patch with the highest admitted reward after invariant, exploit, causal,
hidden-test, and delayed-regression checks.

## Run

```bash
python3 governed_reward_experiment.py
```

Optional parameters:

```bash
python3 governed_reward_experiment.py --tasks 100 --candidates 7 --seed 11
```

Run the multi-seed selector and ablation suite:

```bash
python3 governed_reward_experiment.py \
  --suite \
  --tasks 100 \
  --seed-start 10 \
  --seed-end 30 \
  --candidate-grid 3,5,7,10 \
  --out results/governed_reward_suite.json \
  --report results/governed_reward_suite_report.md
```

Run the executable real-code benchmark:

```bash
python3 real_codebase_experiment.py
```

Run the real-code benchmark with DeepSeek-generated patches:

```bash
read -rs DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
python3 real_codebase_experiment.py \
  --generator deepseek \
  --model deepseek-chat \
  --llm-candidates 12 \
  --out results/deepseek_real_codebase_results_12.json \
  --report results/deepseek_real_codebase_report_12.md
```

## Compared Selectors

- `RawSelector = argmax(raw_reward)`
- `WeightedScalarSelector = argmax(weighted_scalar_reward)`
- `GovernedSelector = argmax(admitted_reward)`
- `OracleSelector = argmax(known_ground_truth_quality)`
- `LargerDiffSelector = argmax(diff_size)`

Raw reward uses visible tests, typecheck, lint, and build.

Governed reward applies hard overrides for test weakening, hardcoding, security
violations, secrets, architecture violations, and public API breaks. Soft checks
discount hidden-test failure, large diffs, weak causal attribution, unnecessary
dependencies, and delayed regressions.

## Headline Metrics

The report compares:

- visible test pass rate
- hidden test pass rate
- reward hacking rate
- hard invariant violation rate
- architecture violation rate
- delayed regression rate
- security regression rate
- public API break rate
- diff size
- maintainability
- causal score
- raw and admitted reward
- hidden-test pass per changed line
- robustness per diff size

## Ablations

The suite compares full governance against removing:

- hard invariant filter
- exploit detector
- hidden test evidence
- delayed regression evidence
- causal attribution
- maintainability discount
